node server.js

cd FrontEnd

   Note:
  	1) The MySQL database for this project was manually configured using XAMPP. The database and tables were created directly through the XAMPP interface without the use of SQL queries. Ensure your MySQL server
    is running and adjust the database configuration in the server.js file if needed.
  	2) MySQL database tables need to be created manually. Adjust the port and database configurations as required in the server.js file.
